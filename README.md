# Energy-based Stabilizer of Dynamical Systems (ESDS)

An implementation of the ESDS approach described in [(Saveriano, 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11290.pdf).

## Demo description
- `main_LASA.m`: a demo to run ESDS on the LASA Handwritten dataset.

## Software Requirements
The code is developed and tested under `Ubuntu 18.04` and `Matlab2019b`.
